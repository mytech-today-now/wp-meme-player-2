    - **Environment Consistency:** Ensure the Docker environment replicates the production setup as closely as possible to avoid discrepancies that could lead to unexpected behaviors or issues during deployment.
    - **Service Definitions:** Define all necessary services (WordPress, MySQL, Node.js) in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, ensuring seamless integration and communication between containers.
    - **Volume Management:** Use Docker volumes to persist data, such as the WordPress content directory and database data, preventing data loss and ensuring data persistence across container restarts.
    - **Networking:** Configure appropriate networking settings to allow communication between containers, ensuring that services can interact effectively and securely.

4. **Documentation and Comments:**
    - **Inline Comments:** Provide detailed inline comments explaining the purpose and functionality of code blocks, enhancing code readability and facilitating future development and maintenance.
    - **External Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, usage, and development guidelines. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for users and developers alike, promoting effective utilization and contribution.
    - **API Documentation:** Document all API endpoints, functions, and classes to assist developers in extending or integrating with the plugin. Clear API documentation fosters community contributions and enhances the plugin's flexibility and functionality.

5. **Testing Strategy:**
    - **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests using PHPUnit for PHP components and Jest or similar frameworks for JavaScript components. Automated testing ensures code reliability and helps catch issues early in the development process.
    - **Continuous Integration:** Set up CI pipelines to run tests automatically on code commits, ensuring code quality and reliability through continuous validation and feedback.
    - **Manual Testing:** Conduct manual testing for user interface elements, drag-and-drop functionality, and other interactive features to ensure a seamless user experience and identify issues that automated tests might miss.
