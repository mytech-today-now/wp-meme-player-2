**Key Requirements:**

1. **Integration of Programming Design Patterns:**
    - **Singleton Pattern:**
        - **Purpose:** Ensure that specific classes within the plugin are instantiated only once throughout the application's lifecycle.
        - **Application:** Utilize this pattern for managing shared resources or configurations, such as the main plugin class or configuration settings, to prevent redundant instances and maintain consistency.

    - **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:**
        - **Model:** Handles all data-related operations, including interactions with the database and WordPress APIs.
        - **View:** Manages the presentation layer, rendering the user interface within both the WordPress admin dashboard and the front-end Playlist Page.
        - **Controller:** Manages the flow of the application by handling user input, processing requests, and coordinating interactions between the Model and View components.

    - **Observer Pattern:**
        - **Purpose:** Enable different parts of the plugin to respond dynamically to events or changes, enhancing modularity.
        - **Application:** Align with WordPress's hook system to allow the plugin to listen for and respond to specific actions or filters, facilitating event-driven interactions.

    - **Decorator Pattern:**
        - **Purpose:** Allow the dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects without altering their existing structure.
        - **Application:** Extend or customize existing WordPress classes within the plugin, providing additional functionalities such as enhanced media handling or custom admin interfaces.

    - **Dependency Injection:**
        - **Purpose:** Promote loose coupling by injecting dependencies into classes rather than hardcoding them.
        - **Application:** Enhance flexibility and testability by allowing easy swapping of components, such as database handlers or API clients, thus facilitating maintenance and scalability.

2. **Adherence to WordPress-Specific Design Patterns:**
    - **Block Patterns:**
        - **Purpose:** Implement reusable layouts and components to streamline content creation.
        - **Application:** Ensure consistency and ease of use within the plugin by providing standardized block patterns for users to create and manage playlists efficiently, integrating seamlessly with the Gutenberg editor.

3. **Docker Environment Setup:**
    - **Dockerfile:**
        - **Purpose:** Define the Docker image configuration.
        - **Content:** Specify the necessary environment for the plugin, including the appropriate versions of PHP, Node.js, and required extensions. Ensure compatibility with WordPress requirements and optimize for performance.

    - **docker-compose.yaml:**
        - **Purpose:** Orchestrate multi-container Docker applications.
        - **Content:** Include configurations for WordPress, MySQL, Node.js, and other dependencies, ensuring seamless integration and communication between services. Define service dependencies, networking, and volume mounts for persistent data storage.

    - **.env File:**
        - **Purpose:** Securely manage environment variables.
        - **Content:** Store sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and secret tokens, ensuring they are not exposed within the codebase. Implement best practices for environment variable management to enhance security.

    - **Web Server Configuration:**
        - **Options:** Configure Nginx or Apache within the Docker container.
        - **Focus:** Optimize settings for performance and security, including setting appropriate headers, enabling SSL/TLS, and configuring caching mechanisms to ensure efficient and secure operation of the plugin.

    - **PHP and Node.js Configuration:**
        - **Purpose:** Ensure the Docker instance includes the correct versions of PHP and Node.js.
        - **Content:** Include necessary extensions and packages required by the plugin to function correctly, such as PHP extensions for image processing or Node.js packages for build tools and asset management.

    - **Database Initialization:**
        - **Method:** Use `init.sql` scripts.
        - **Purpose:** Set up the MySQL database schema required by WordPress and the plugin, ensuring the correct structure and initial data are in place. Include necessary tables, indexes, and seed data to facilitate plugin functionality.

4. **Plugin Structure and Components:**
    - **Namespace:**
        - **Purpose:** Organize the plugin's PHP classes under a specific namespace (e.g., `DPM` for Dynamic Playlist Manager).
        - **Benefit:** Prevent naming collisions and enhance autoloading capabilities, ensuring that the plugin's classes are encapsulated and do not interfere with other plugins or WordPress core classes.

    - **Prefixing:**
        - **Purpose:** Prefix all option names, functions, and variables with `dpm_`.
        - **Benefit:** Maintain consistency and avoid conflicts with other plugins. If a file name matches a WordPress core file, prefix it with `dpm_` or adopt an industry-standard method to resolve the conflict.

    - **Naming Conventions:**
        - **Handles:** Use `kebab-case` for handles, such as script and style handles (`dpm-playlist-script`).
        - **Variables, Functions, and Identifiers:** Use `snake_case` to adhere to WordPress coding standards (`$playlist_items`, `dpm_get_playlists()`).

    - **Actions and Filters:**
        - **Purpose:** Leverage both built-in and custom WordPress actions and filters.
        - **Application:** Extend and modify WordPress functionality in a standardized manner, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration. Implement custom hooks (`dpm_before_playlist_display`) to allow other developers to extend plugin functionalities.
