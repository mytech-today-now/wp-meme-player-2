# Refactored Prompt for Generating a WordPress Plugin in Docker

---

## **Objective**

You are tasked with developing a comprehensive and feature-rich WordPress plugin named **“Dynamic Playlist Manager”** within a Dockerized environment. This setup ensures consistency, scalability, and ease of deployment across various systems. The primary goal of this plugin is to empower content creators by enabling them to effortlessly add, manage, and display custom playlists on a dedicated Playlist Page within their WordPress site.

### **Plugin Overview**

- **Playlists Page:** Displays a dynamic, color-coded grid of playlist items with extensive options for sorting, grouping, and customization to enhance user engagement and content discoverability.
- **Playlist Playback Page:** Serves as the playback interface for individual playlists, optimized for public viewing without editing controls to ensure a clean and distraction-free experience.
- **JavaScript Code:** Powers dynamic interactions and functionalities on the front-end of websites utilizing the plugin.
- **Shortcode:** Allows seamless insertion of the Playlist Playback Page into local WordPress sites.

### **Playback Modes**

1. **Full Window with Hover to Visibility Controls:** The playlist occupies the entire window, offering an immersive experience. Visibility controls appear only when the user hovers over the playlist, maintaining a minimalist interface.
2. **Confine the Playback to the Playback Frame:** The playlist is contained within a designated playback frame on the page, allowing other content to coexist without interference. Visibility controls are always visible or appear upon specific user interactions as defined by the Creator.

Your response should be an exceptionally thorough and meticulously refactored prompt that delves deeply into each component of the plugin. Every aspect must be explained in detail to ensure absolute clarity and understanding. This prompt is intended to serve as the foundational blueprint for a series of subsequent development activities. Therefore, it is paramount that every detail is elaborated upon with precision to facilitate seamless future enhancements, integrations, and maintenance.

## **Key Requirements**

### 1. Plugin Structure and Components

#### 1.1 Namespace
- **Purpose:** Organize the plugin's PHP classes under a specific namespace (e.g., `DPM` for Dynamic Playlist Manager).
- **Benefit:** Prevent naming collisions and enhance autoloading capabilities, ensuring that the plugin's classes are encapsulated and do not interfere with other plugins or WordPress core classes.

#### 1.2 Prefixing
- **Purpose:** Prefix all option names, functions, and variables with `dpm_`.
- **Benefit:** Maintain consistency and avoid conflicts with other plugins. If a file name matches a WordPress core file, prefix it with `dpm_` or use an industry-standard method to resolve the conflict.

#### 1.3 Naming Conventions
- **Handles:** Use `kebab-case` for handles, such as script and style handles (e.g., `dpm-playlist-script`).
- **Variables, Functions, and Identifiers:** Use `snake_case` to adhere to WordPress coding standards (e.g., `$playlist_items`, `dpm_get_playlists()`).

#### 1.4 Actions and Filters
- **Purpose:** Leverage both built-in and custom WordPress actions and filters to extend and modify WordPress functionality in a standardized manner.
